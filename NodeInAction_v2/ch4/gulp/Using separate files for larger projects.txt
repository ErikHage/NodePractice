Use node's module system for loading plugins. Can be used to split up large gulpfiles.

Steps:
	1. Create a folder called gulp, and a subfolder called tasks.
	2. Define your tasks by using the usual gulp.task() syntax in separate files. One file per task is agood rule of thumb.
	3. Create a file called gulp/index.js to require each Gulp task file.
	4. Require the gulp/index.js file in gulpfile.js
	
The file tree should look like this:

	gulpfile.js
	gulp/
	gulp/index.js
	gulp/tasks/development-build.js
	gulp/tasks/production-build.js
	
Can be paired with the gulp-help module to document Gulp tasks
